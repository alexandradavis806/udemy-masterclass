Singly Linked Lists:

adding a new node: 
- requires you to link your new node to the current head node

removing a node:
- to properly maintain the list wen removing a node from the middle of a linked list, you need to adjust the link on the previous node so that it points to the following node
- depending on language, nodes which are not referenced are removed automatically
- "removing" a node is equivalent to removing all references of the node

Linked Lists:
- are compromised of nodes
- nodes contain a link to the next node 
- can be uni or bidirectional 
- are a basic DS, and form the basis for many other DS
- have a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
- require some maintenance in order to add or remove nodes
